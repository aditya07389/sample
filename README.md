# Project Brief – Photovoltaic Plant Optimal Location Detector

This project is a **machine learning–based tool** to identify and rank optimal locations for photovoltaic (solar) power plants in Karnataka. It integrates multiple geospatial and environmental datasets — including **solar irradiance, rainfall, temperature, elevation, land cover, and grid proximity** — into a unified pipeline.

A **neural network regressor** predicts a “suitability score” for each grid location, helping decision-makers prioritize high-potential sites. The system also features **interactive heatmaps** for visualization.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Sources:** Public APIs and satellite datasets (climate, topography, infrastructure).  
- **Pipeline:** Data ingestion → preprocessing → neural regression model → visualization.  
- **Performance:** Achieved **R² score of 0.998** on test data, with minimal overfitting.  
- **Impact:** Scalable, objective, and significantly reduces manual site assessment effort.
